# CNC Project Template

I have made this repository to be a template that can be used to store CNC project file(s) so that they can be shared publically. Initially I thought to use Github because as a new CNC-er it would help to have revision control of my CNC project file. 

I have access to a CNC machine at my men's shed. I am a member of the [Westhill Men's Shed](https://westhillmensshed.co.uk/) and I have started to try and learn how to use our Genmitsu 6050 XL CNC.

In this section, I should elaborate and describe my project.

The inspiration for this project was ...

And this is a preview of what my design looks like:
