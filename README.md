# My Desk Name Sign

I have access to a CNC machine at my men's shed. I am a member of the [Westhill Men's Shed](https://westhillmensshed.co.uk/) and I have started to try and learn how to use our Genmitsu 6050 XL CNC. I was able to start my very first CNC project on the 30th May 2025 which was a simple job of just engraving my name 'Chris'. The Shed had just bought a brand new computer for driving the CNC and we were using this to help test out getting the CNC and the computer set up.

In this section, I should elaborate and describe my project.

The inspiration for this project was ... 

And this is a preview of what my design looks like:
